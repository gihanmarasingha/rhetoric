*Gorgias* is a dialogue (or series thereof) between Socrates and the sophists/rhetoricians Gorgias,
Polus, and Callicles.  It examines the nature of rhetoric, happiness, virtue, good, and morality.

In broad terms, made more precise in the dialogue, rhetoric is the art of speaking persuasively.
Sophists were itinerant teachers who instructed powerful young men, for a fee, on topics such as
rhetoric, philosophy, and *arete* (moral virtue / excellence). In *Gorgias*, Socrates sometimes
refers to sophistry as being concerned with the legislative process and of rhetoric as being
concerned with the administration of justice. 

Socrates argues that rhetoric only serves to flatter its listeners in order to advance the position
of the rhetorician. This is in contrast with philosophy which aims to educate.

To give a foundation to Socrates' vehemence, it helps to understand the historical context. The
dialogue takes place around the time of the Peloponnesian war (431--404 BC)---a large-scale war
fought primarily between Athens and Sparta. At this time, Athens was a radical democracy. All free
adult Athenian citizens could attend the Assembly (*ekklesia*) and take part in decision-making by
discussing and voting on legislation and policy. The Council of 500 (*boule*) set the agenda of the
Assembly and managed the regular running of Athens. Its members were drawn by lot and served for a
year. Likewise, each court (*dikasteria*) case was decided by a large jury, also selected by lot.

To Socrates, the main problem with this kind of democracy is that it gives disproportionate
prominence to rhetoricians: men who do not provide Athens the medicine it needs but instead provide
her with sweet treats that are pleasing but bad. Thus, rhetoric is not a true *tekhne* (craft, art,
expertise) but is instead a kind of knack.

## The nature of Socrates' arguments in *Gorgias*

Many of Socrates' arguments seem, at first blush, to be weak. For instance, he gets Polus (466) to
agree that rhetoricians, when they do "what they think it's best for them to do" they do not do
"what they want".

His style of argument is called *elenchus* or the Socratic method. It is a method of refutation. His
interlocutor asserts a thesis $p$. Socrates encourages him to assent to further premises, say $q$
and $r$, and concludes by demonstrating that *not* $p$ is a conclusion of $q$ and $r$. 

Technically, all Socrates has shown is that the set $\{p, q, r\}$ is inconsistent. But he goes
further and claims that not $p$ is *true*. Waterfield argues that this "truth" is a conditional kind
of truth, subject to further interrogation via the elenchus. He calls this "correctable truth". 

I take the following example directly from the introduction to Waterfield's translation. In 466,
Polus' claim *p* and the premises *q* and *r*, to which he assents are:

* *p* Polus maintains that rhetoricians are powerful because they do what they want;
* *q* Polus agrees that power is a good thing for its possessor;
* *r* Polus agrees that we only ever want what is good for us.

Socrates uses premises *q* and *r* to prove the negation of *p*. Since Polus agreed to *q* and *r*,
he cannot believe also in *p*. In fact, Socrates convinces Polus to reject his prior belief in *p*
to give the new set $\{\text{not p}, q, r\}$ of beliefs.

## Socrates questions Gorgias to determine what rhetoric is

The first dialogue (447--460) is between Socrates and the Sicilian rhetorician and sophist Gorgias.
Socrates probes Gorgias to determine what area of expertise and what province is the concern of
rhetoric. The dialogue ends by examining the capacity for immorality of rhetoricians.

In the course of this dialogue, Gorgias asserts *p*: rhetoricians can persuade a non-expert audience
and can do so immorally. Socrates gets Gorgias to agree to *q*: rhetoric is an area of expertise;
its practitioners thus understand the province of rhetoric, *r* the province of rhetoric is right
and wrong (morality), *s* anyone who understands morality must be moral and must act morally.
Clearly *q*, *r*, and *s* contradict *p*.


Socrates and Chaerephon have arrived late to a house where Gorgias has been speaking. They begin
speaking with acquaintances Callicles and Polus regarding what is Gorgias' "particular branch of
expertise".

Instead of answering the question, Polus gives what Socrates characterises as a rhetorical answer,
praising Gorgias' art as the finest area of expertise (448c), describing the *qualities* of rhetoric
rather than defining *what it is*.

To approach an answer, Socrates enters a dialogue with Gorgias who immediately claims to be a
rhetorician and a teacher of rhetoric (449a).

Socrates questions Gorgias to determine "what aspect of life" (or "province") rhetoric is concerned
with, in the sense that the province of weaving is the manufacture of cloth. Polus answers
"speaking" and is further encouraged to assert that the study of rhetoric makes people competent at
understanding what they're talking about.

However, not all speaking is rhetoric. Socrates asserts that expertise in medicine makes one
competent at speaking about people who are ill, and so medicine is also concerned with speaking, as
is every area of expertise. He pre-empts a possible objection by Polus, noting that medicine also
has a practical aspect and some areas of expertise, such as sculpture, have no speaking aspect. But
rhetoric is not the only activity which is only concerned with speaking. Mathematics is one other
such example (450e).

Socrates persists in trying to pin down the province of rhetoric, sometimes by asking what rhetoric
is *responsible for [producing]*, just as medicine is responsible for health and the trainer's area
of expertise is responsible for producing fit bodies.

Gorgias responds that rhetoric is "responsible for personal freedom and enables an individual to
gain political power in his community". When pressed to say what rhetoric *is*, he responds, that it
is "the ability to use the spoken word to persuade---to persuade the jurors in the courts, the
members of the Council, the citizens attending the assembly".

This is still unsatisfactory to Socrates, "isn't it the case that nay teacher of any subject
persuades his students of what he's trying to get them to understand?". He says mathematics is an
agent of educational persuasion and its province is odd and even numbers.

The subsequent inquiry takes two directions: to determine what *kind* of persuasion rhetoric is,
and the uncover its province. Gorgias quickly asserts that "right and wrong" is the province. As to
the kind of persuasion, Socrates distinguishes between persuasion that aims to convince, heedless of
the truth value of its claims, and persuasion that leads to knowledge and understanding.

By this point of the argument, Socrates almost has enough ammunition to gun down Gorgias. He
sneakily suggests (455b) that in a public meeting in Athens, advice on building dockyards would be
asked from master builders, not rhetoricians. This is simply not the case, says Gorgias. A
rhetorician will be believed on any topic, even before an expert on that topic. 

He suddenly goes on the defensive, unnecessarily. Gorgias is at pains to make clear (457) that this
power can be, but should not be, abused and that the fault for any abuse should be heaped on the
given rhetorician, not on their teacher. This admission that rhetoric can be used for immoral
purposes is crucial to Socrates' later argument.

Pressing the prior point on persuading the masses even against the evidence of a doctor, Socrates
gets Gorgias to admit that this persuasion must have non-doctor as its audience. More generally, the
rhetorician can best persuade when speaking to non-experts. This leads to Socrates' most powerful
question in the dialogue with Gorgias. He asks (459d,e) if the same is true when the topic of
discussion is right and wrong. Or whether the rhetorician must be an expert on that topic. Whether a
teacher of rhetoric would furnish their students with lessons on morality if they were not already
experts. Gorgias answers that a rhetorician must be an expert in morality and be required to teach
morality to their students. Socrates has tricked Gorgias into this statement! For how could Gorgias
claim otherwise in public.

The next line of questioning is also a trap into which Gorgias falls. Socrates asserts that someone
who comes to understanding building is a builder, that someone who comes to understand music is a
musician, and thereby gains Gorgias' assent that someone who has come to understand morality is
moral. This is not at all clearly true. However, Socrates uses this admission, together with
Gorgias' prior admission that rhetoricians have expertise in morality, to infer that rhetoricians
must be moral and therefore must behave morally. But this contradicts Gorgias' earlier assertion
that rhetoricians can behave immorally.

## Rhetoric as a branch of flattery; doing what one wants

Having defeated Gorgias, Socrates continues his dialogue with Gorgias' young student Polus. In this
dialogue, he begins to show his own thoughts about rhetoric, describing it as a branch of flattery,
rather than as any area of expertise, aimed merely to give pleasure. The question of morality comes
to the fore. Socrates shows that rhetoricians are not, despite Polus' claims, powerful people. Polus
observes that rhetoricians, like dictators can have whomever they want put to death or confiscate
their property. They do what they think it's best for them to do. However, such things are not
always good (for the agent). Since we can only be said to want that which is good for us,
rhetoricians do not do what they want.

Polus (461b) begins by upbraiding Socrates for tricking Gorgias into making a claim (that a
rhetorician is an expert in morality and teaches it to his pupils) which led to a contradiction. He
asks Socrates to say what kind of expertise rhetoric is. The response is that rhetoric isn't an area
of expertise at all, but is an "experiential knack".

Rhetoric, so claims Socrates, is a branch of a more general knack---flattery (461c--e). As with
other branches of flattery---such as cooking (properly *opsopoiia*, on which more later),
ornamentation (cosmetics), and sophistry---it is a knack at producing pleasure and gratification.
The word 'knack' is a translation of *emperia*. See the [Glossary](#glossary-of-greek-terms) for the
definition. 

To expand on this, Socrates explains that there are, in essence, two provinces of expertise (464b):
the body and the mind/soul (*psyche*). The broad area of expertise that pertains to mind is
statesmanship. It has two forms: the legislative process and the administration of justice. The
corresponding areas of expertise that pertain to the body are gymnastics (exercise) and medicine.

This division my seem reductive, particular as it concerns the mind, but it shows that Socrates sees
statesmanship as the overarching framework for addressing the needs of the psyche. Philosophy, as an area of expertise, falls within this framework as the foundation for statesmanship.

What each branch expertise aims for is what's best for the body or the mind, unlike knacks which are
concerned with immediate pleasure.

If this seems questionable, note that 'cooking' is an approximate translation of *opsopoiia*,
referring to the preparation of *opson*, a 'relish' that would be served with staple cereal-based
foods (*sitos*). By relish is meant something that provides flavour, such as cheese, meat, or fish.
These were often considered indulgent luxuries.

## Glossary of Greek terms

* *agathos* (adj): good. As with the English word 'good', *agathos* can denote the quality of
  possessing moral good, usefulness, or excellence, that is, of possessing *arete*. It can be used
  as a noun in phrases like 'the good'.
* *arete* (noun): virtue / excellence / good. Originally denoting manly attributes such as valour
  and courage. It came to denote inner qualities akin to our modern notion of moral virtue. Both
  meanings exist simultaneously in Plato, albeit with a strong emphasis on the moral connotation.
* *emperia* (noun): knack. An experience or practical skill derived from trial and error or
  'habituation', often without a deeper theoretical understanding or systematic basis.
* *eudaimonia* (noun): happiness. Literally good spirit. This is what all Greeks would aim for. But
  they would differ regarding the nature of *eudaimonia*. To Socrates, *eudaimonia* is not simply a
  matter of gaining pleasure or gratification. Rather, it is that which attends virtue, by aligning
  ones life with the good. 
* *psyche* (noun): mind and soul.
