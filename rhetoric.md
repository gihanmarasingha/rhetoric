## Introducing Rhetoric

The purpose of Wendy Olmsted's book is to present rhetoric by examining rhetorical texts and
examples in their historical context. It asserts that this is the correct way to develop the proper
capacities of a good rhetorician --- inventing subjects and arguments, organising discourse, and
making good judgements.

The book is divided into three parts. Part I considers the classical rhetorical traditions and
introduces the basic ideas and terminology. Part II examines how the literary texts of Milton,
Austen, and Bacon interpret the works discussed in Part I. Part III argues that "classical
rhetorical tradition informs central intellectual movements of our own time". The focus is on
literary texts, politics, and legal arguments.

# Part I --- Classical Rhetorical Traditions

## Introduction

Part I introduced the "ambiguities, challenges, and opportunities of trying to discover the most
practical and best actions" in situations where we deliberate without perfect knowledge. Inevitably,
such decisions are affected by emotions. This happens even, as Francis Bacon put it, in "negotiation
within ourselves".

Chapter 1 explores Plato's *Gorgias*, its attack on demagogic speakers who used pleasure to
manipulate their audiences and Aristole's response, in *Rhetoric*, in which he rejects the earlier
rhetorical texts based on emotion and turns to argument as the central pillar. Speakers must address
facts and arguments (logos), how they manifest a trustworthy character (ethos), and how to produce
reasonable emotion in an audience (pathos).

FILL THIS IN.

## Chapter 1 --- The Rhetorician: Demagogue or Statesman? Plato's *Gorgias* and Aristotle's *Rhetoric*

Plato's *Gorgias* is a Socratic dialogue in which Socrates debates with orators, including Gorgias,
to determine the nature of rhetoric. Socrates asserts that rhetoric is a form of flattery, used for
selfish reasons. That it is just a knack for causing pleasure. It engenders not knowledge but belief
(*pistis*) in an ignorant audience. 

Just as a pastry baker would win against a doctor in a competition in front of children, so a
flatterer would win in a competition win one who knows what is just for the state.

For Socrates,
